#13. Lambda Syntax
"""
    

Lambda functions are defined using the following syntax:

my_list = range(16)
filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)

Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.

If you plan on creating a function you'll use over and over, you're better off using def and giving that function a name.
