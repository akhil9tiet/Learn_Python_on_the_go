"""Create a variable, my_file, and set it equal to calling the open() function on output.txt. In this case, pass "r+" as a second argument to the function so the file will allow you to read and write to it! (See the Hint for details.)"""
my_file = "Null"    #declaring the file
my_file = open("output.txt", "r+") #r+ is read and write
