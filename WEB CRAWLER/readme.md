THis is the first project file to display how crawling is done.

In the folder where the root directory is we make a folder with the name of the project. In our case we have "indian_ngo" folder.

Now we will create two files
*queue- which will contain all the list of links which have to be read
*crawled- which will containe all the list of the links which have already been read
